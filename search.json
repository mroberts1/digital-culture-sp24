It can also be defined more broadly, however, as a set of networked, technologically-mediated practices of communication, structured by economic and political forces that both inflect and are inflected by social and cultural identities. These platforms, the social practices that they enable, and the relationship between the two are the objects of social media theory. But what does it mean to theorize social media? Why do we need social media theory at all?\nTo theorize something involves a number of processes:\n\nfirst, how do we define the phenomenon or object of study itself? How does it differ from previous or other related phenomena?\nhow are we to account for it? Why did it happen/is it happening now rather than at some other time? What are its conditions of possibility?\nwhat is its relation to larger areas of society? What are its implications for those areas?\nhow are we to evaluate it, in terms of its implications (political, economic, social, ethical, legal, environmental, aesthetic)? What are its possibilities and limits, its progressive and oppressive aspects? How can we change it for the better?\n\nThese processes involve developing analytical frameworks or models comprising concepts that are useful for identifying and analyzing key aspects of and issues raised by the phenomenon/object in question. These frameworks and concepts typically draw from existing ones in different fields of study, but often involve the proposal of new frameworks and concepts specific to the field in question.\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of the course, students will be able to:\n\nanalyze technologies past, present, and imagined\ndescribe the ways in which technologies shape our world the ways in which we shape those technologies\nexplain how social media is a result of the intersection between technologies and existing human communication dynamics\ndiscuss how theory of technology and social media can improve the vocational outlook of a student\nplay a productive role in and facilitate conversations that tease out the relationships between values and technology.\n\nthrough the skills you will refine in writing your research papers, clearly explain how a specific technology shapes the social world that we live in.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese sources are either available online or excerpts will be posted on Blackboard.\n\nAmy Bruckman, Should You Believe Wikipedia?

Time management, preparation for our meetings, and timely submission of your work comprise a significant dimension of your professionalism. As such, your work must be completed by the beginning of class on the day it is due. If you have a serious problem that makes punctual submission impossible, you must discuss this matter with me before the due date so that we can make alternative arrangements. Because you are given plenty of time to complete your work, and major due dates are given to you well in advance, last minute problems should not preclude handing in assignments on time.\n\n\n\n\nFitchburg State University is committed to providing a safe learning environment for all students that is free of all forms of discrimination and harassment. Please be aware all FSU faculty members are “mandatory reporters,” which means that if you tell me about a situation involving sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, I am legally required to share that information with the Title IX Coordinator. If you or someone you know has been impacted by sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, or stalking, FSU has staff members trained to support you. If you or someone you know has been impacted by sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, or stalking, please visit http://fitchburgstate.edu/titleix to access information about university support and resources.\n\n\n\n\nHealth Services\nHours: Monday-Friday 8:30AM-5PM Location: Ground Level of Russell Towers (across from the entrance of Holmes Dining Hall) Phone: (978) 665-3643/3894\nCounseling Services\nThe Counseling Services Office offers a range of services including individual, couples and group counseling, crisis intervention, psychoeducational programming, outreach ALTERNATIVE ECOSYSTEMSs, and community referrals. Counseling services are confidential and are offered at no charge to all enrolled students. Staff at Counseling Services are also available for consultation to faculty, staff and students. Counseling Services is located in the Hammond, 3rd Floor, Room 317.\nFitchburg Anti-Violence Education (FAVE)\nFAVE collaborates with a number of community partners (e.g., YWCA Domestic Violence Services, Pathways for Change) to meet our training needs and to link survivors with community based resources. This site also features resources for help or information about dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking. If you or someone you know is in an abusive relationship or has been a victim of sexual assault, there are many places to go for help. Many can be accessed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. On campus, free and confidential support is provided at both Counseling Services and Health Services.\nCommunity Food Pantry Food insecurity is a growing issue and it certainly can affect student learning. The ability to have access to nutritious food is incredibly vital. The Falcon Bazaar, located in Hammond G 15, is stocked with food, basic necessities, and can provide meal swipes to support all Fitchburg State students experiencing food insecurity for a day or a semester.\nThe university continues to partner with Our Father’s House to support student needs and access to food and services. All Fitchburg State University students are welcome at the Our Father’s House Community Food Pantry. This Pantry is located at the Faith Christian Church at 40 Boutelle St., Fitchburg, MA and is open from 5-7pm. Each “household” may shop for nutritious food once per month by presenting a valid FSU ID.\n\n\n\n\nThe University “Academic Integrity” policy can be found online at http:// www.fitchburgstate.edu/offices-services-directory/office-of-student-conductmediation-education/academic-integrity/. Students are expected to do their own work. Plagiarism and cheating are inexcusable. Any instance of plagiarism or cheating will automatically result in a zero on the assignment and may be reported the Office of Student and Academic Life at the discretion of the instructor.\nPlagiarism includes, but is not limited to: - Using papers or work from another class. - Using another student’s paper or work from any class. - Copying work or a paper from the Internet. - The egregious lack of citing sources or documenting research.\nIf you’re not clear on what is or is not plagiarism, ASK. The BEST case scenario if caught is a zero on that assignment, and ignorance of what does or does not count is not an excuse. That being said, I’m a strong supporter of Fair Use doctrine. Just attribute what you use–and, again, ASK if there’s any doubt.\n\n\n\n\nIf you need course adaptations or accommodations because of a disability, if you have emergency medical information to share with the instructor, or if you need special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please inform the faculty member as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\nAt some point during the semester you will likely have a problem with technology. Your laptop will crash; your iPad battery will die; a recording you make will disappear; you will accidentally delete a file; the wireless will go down at a crucial time. These, however, are inevitabilities of life, not emergences. Technology problems are not excuses for unfinished or late work. Bad things may happen, but you can protect yourself by doing the following:\n\nPlan ahead: A deadline is the last minute to turn in material. You can start—and finish—early, particularly if challenging resources are required, or you know it will be time consuming to finish this project.\nSave work early and often: Think how much work you do in 10 minutes. I auto save every 2 minutes.\nMake regular backups of files in a different location: Between Box, Google Drive, Dropbox, and iCloud, you have ample places to store and backup your materials. Use them.\nSave drafts: When editing, set aside the original and work with a copy.\nPractice safe computing: On your personal devices, install and use software to control viruses and malware.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading for the course will follow the FSU grading policy below:\n4.0: 95-100\n3.7: 92-94\n3.5: 89-91\n3.3: 86-88\n3.0: 83-85\n2.7: 80-82\n2.5: 77-79\n2.3: 74-76\n2.0: 71-73\n0.0: &lt; 70\n\n\n\n\nWriting Center\nAcademic Policies\nDisability Services\nFitchburg State Alert system for emergencies, snow closures/delays, and faculty absences\nUniversity Career Services"

Any instance of plagiarism or cheating will automatically result in a zero on the assignment and may be reported the Office of Student and Academic Life at the discretion of the instructor.\nPlagiarism includes, but is not limited to: - Using papers or work from another class. - Using another student’s paper or work from any class. - Copying work or a paper from the Internet. - The egregious lack of citing sources or documenting research.\nIf you’re not clear on what is or is not plagiarism, ASK. The BEST case scenario if caught is a zero on that assignment, and ignorance of what does or does not count is not an excuse. That being said, I’m a strong supporter of Fair Use doctrine. Just attribute what you use–and, again, ASK if there’s any doubt.\n\n\n\n\nIf you need course adaptations or accommodations because of a disability, if you have emergency medical information to share with the instructor, or if you need special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please inform the faculty member as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\nAt some point during the semester you will likely have a problem with technology. Your laptop will crash; your iPad battery will die; a recording you make will disappear; you will accidentally delete a file; the wireless will go down at a crucial time. These, however, are inevitabilities of life, not emergences. Technology problems are not excuses for unfinished or late work. Bad things may happen, but you can protect yourself by doing the following:\n\nPlan ahead: A deadline is the last minute to turn in material. You can start—and finish—early, particularly if challenging resources are required, or you know it will be time consuming to finish this project.\nSave work early and often: Think how much work you do in 10 minutes. I auto save every 2 minutes.\nMake regular backups of files in a different location: Between Box, Google Drive, Dropbox, and iCloud, you have ample places to store and backup your materials. Use them.\nSave drafts: When editing, set aside the original and work with a copy.\nPractice safe computing: On your personal devices, install and use software to control viruses and malware.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading for the course will follow the FSU grading policy below:\n4.0: 95-100\n3.7: 92-94\n3.5: 89-91\n3.3: 86-88\n3.0: 83-85\n2.7: 80-82\n2.5: 77-79\n2.3: 74-76\n2.0: 71-73\n0.0: &lt; 70\n\n\n\n\nWriting Center\nAcademic Policies\nDisability Services\nFitchburg State Alert system for emergencies, snow closures/delays, and faculty absences\nUniversity Career Services"

Broadly speaking, this can be defined as the diverse range of symbolic practices through which communities affirm and maintain their cultural identities using digital media devices and interfaces in a globally networked society. While these practices are structured by deeply unequal power relations, are contradictory, and often come into conflict with one another, collectively they constitute what may be considered a global digital culture.\nA key component of the course is the automation of various forms of creative production, from writing to the visual arts, by natural-language processing computational systems (generally referred to as “artificial intelligence” or “AI”). The course addresses some of the many issues raised by such systems, with a particular focus on questions of aesthetics and the increasingly contested relationship between artists and algorithms. While such systems now demonstrably pass the Turing Test (i.e. pass as human or their products as human-produced), they also compel us to reconsider what we mean by “art,” or “intelligence” itself.\nA major theme of the course is the changing status of the future as a social imaginary. It has been suggested that while we live today in the futures imagined by writers and filmmakers since George Orwell’s novel 1984 (1949) and films like 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Blade Runner (1982, set in 2019 and later 2049), or Soylent Green (1973, set in 2022), postmodern society has become so absorbed in commemorating its own past that it has become incapable of imagining its own future, dystopian or otherwise. As the course shows, historical projections of the future (often referred to as retrofutures) have paradoxically themselves become objects of postmodernist nostalgia.\n\n\n\n\nThis is primarily a critical-thinking course, although it includes a practical and production component. This means that it encourages you to think reflexively and analytically about the digitally-mediated cultural practices that the course considers, as well as to participate in them; for example, you will be invited to experiment with image-synthesis and text-generating software and analyze the results using key concepts and theoretical frameworks.\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of the course, students will:\n\nhave acquired a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and political dimensions of digital technologies and networked communication;\nbe able to apply critical thinking to contemporary developments in digital culture using relevant analytical concepts and both qualitative and quantitative methodologies such as cultural analytics;\nunderstand basic principles of algorithmic image synthesis on a variety of platforms;\nhave reflected upon and discussed the larger significance of machine learning systems within global networked societies.\n\n\n\n\n\nSelected chapters from the texts below will be made available as PDFs; you are nevertheless encouraged to purchase at least several of texts that are of interest and read more of them.\nNote on formats: A number of texts listed in the bibliography are available as e-books and/or audiobooks. You are encouraged to make use not only of print media but also of these screen-based and audio formats.\n\nLev Manovich and Emanuele Arielli.

It has been suggested that while we live today in the futures imagined by writers and filmmakers since George Orwell’s novel 1984 (1949) and films like 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Blade Runner (1982, set in 2019 and later 2049), or Soylent Green (1973, set in 2022), postmodern society has become so absorbed in commemorating its own past that it has become incapable of imagining its own future, dystopian or otherwise. As the course shows, historical projections of the future (often referred to as retrofutures) have paradoxically themselves become objects of postmodernist nostalgia.\n\n\n\n\nThis is primarily a critical-thinking course, although it includes a practical and production component. This means that it encourages you to think reflexively and analytically about the digitally-mediated cultural practices that the course considers, as well as to participate in them; for example, you will be invited to experiment with image-synthesis and text-generating software and analyze the results using key concepts and theoretical frameworks.\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of the course, students will:\n\nhave acquired a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and political dimensions of digital technologies and networked communication;\nbe able to apply critical thinking to contemporary developments in digital culture using relevant analytical concepts and both qualitative and quantitative methodologies such as cultural analytics;\nunderstand basic principles of algorithmic image synthesis on a variety of platforms;\nhave reflected upon and discussed the larger significance of machine learning systems within global networked societies.\n\n\n\n\n\nSelected chapters from the texts below will be made available as PDFs; you are nevertheless encouraged to purchase at least several of texts that are of interest and read more of them.\nNote on formats: A number of texts listed in the bibliography are available as e-books and/or audiobooks. You are encouraged to make use not only of print media but also of these screen-based and audio formats.\n\nLev Manovich and Emanuele Arielli.

    "text": "For a quick intro, watch this video:\n\nThen read one or more of these articles:\n\nA Friendly Introduction to the Fediverse\nGuide to the Fediverse\nWhat Is Mastodon?\n\nIf you’re wondering why you should care about distributed social networks, read this article.\nMastodon is a loosely-connected network of communities, similar in some ways to the federated  structure of the U.S. itself - hence the term fediverse. You can think of it like a large, interconnected network of Twitters, albeit without ads or data-collecting. Mastodon (like Pleroma) is basically software that enables anyone to set up their own social media server and host a community on it - you can even do it yourself. \nEach Mastodon community (more commonly known as an instance) has its own particular flavor, and there are communities in many languages. Each community also has its terms of service, that you should read carefully and observe.\nMastodon instances vary in size from just a handful of members to thousands. Many allow you to register a new account without approval, but for a lot you have to submit a registration request and may not be approved because some instances limit numbers to people who are referred by existing members. This is because communities typically have a very specific focus, whatever that may be. My own community, for example, is comprised mainly of coders, game designers, and digital artists. You can still read posts, though - if you’re interested, here’s my account page.\nInstances are connected with one another, so that you only need to set up an account on one. If you follow someone on a different instance, that person’s posts on that instance will appear in your feed on your instance - the federated model again.\nOf course, if people on one instance don’t like the community on another, for whatever reason, they can simply disconnect from it. So the affordances of instances, and the relations between them, are quite resilient against the usual abuses of social media like trolling, spamming, etc.\nChoosing an instance to register with may seem tricky at the beginning because there are so many! Take your time, and keep in mind that you can always switch instances later if you find another one that you like better - or just have multiple accounts on several instances (I have 5-6).\nAfter you join a community, just hang out there and see what goes on. Be sure to follow the account @feditips@mstdn.social, which has lots of useful tips about using Mastodon and other distributed services."
